\chapter{Results and Data Analysis}
% 'Results and Discussion' better?
\label{results} 


% should contain:
% runtime measurements
% genus/strain/species
% strain+species
% ML scoring function and feature selection


\section{ML evaluation}
% maybe overview table?

\section{Algorithm choice}
% which algo is best? depends

\section{Performance of taxonomic profilers}
% where is kraken better? mpa good performance overall

\section{Influence of taxonomic level}
% depends on illness, strain+species appears to be good

\section{Feature selection}
% reduces runtime, not much else here

\section{Runtime measurements}
% need to figure this out --> do measurements!!!
